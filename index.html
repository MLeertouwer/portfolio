        <br>
        <p class="lead">I'm currently a student Software Development at ROC Rivor in Tiel and I have a huge passion for
            web development.
            In my free time I love to write and read books, solve lots of Rubiks Cubes, go running and hiking, designing
            stuff and of course to work on my own websites/webapplications.
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> Right now, personally and for school, my biggest focus is on learning the basics, ins and outs
            of Bootstrap,
            because I love making stylish and functional websites and webapplications. This portfolio website is also
            part of
            my learning process in learning Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> Next to that, I'm learning Laravel as backend framework and build school assigments with it.
            My first project with Laravel, called Universal World, started as a school assigment, but I decided to
            continue working on the styling
            and making it more visually appealing using Bootstrap to implement and improve my skills.
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> I hope you enjoy my portfolio and the projects I've worked on. Feel free to reach out if you
            have any questions or just want to connect!</p>
